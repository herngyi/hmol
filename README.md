Basic features of the program include:
- Rotate and zoom into molecules
- Save and open molecule data files
- Basic numerical data display (e.g. Molar mass)
- Different viewing options: Ball-and-stick/Space-filling/skeletal, color
  filters that visualize data, etc.
- Display parts of molecules packaged into convex hulls for conceptual
  organization (e.g. highlight nucleic acids in DNA or sugar units in starch)
